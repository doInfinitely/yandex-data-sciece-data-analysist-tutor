I spent 1 hour each on tasks 1 and 2.

Task 4: A Dataframe can contain one or more Series, or a Dataframe is a *collection* of Series. *Time taken: 30 seconds*

Task 5: I would explain to the student that the logic is mostly correct but that the indentation of the return statement in their solution implies that the function will return prematurely. I would demonstrate this by stepping through the function manually with the student. *Time taken: 30 seconds*

Task 6: 2^2\*2+3^2\*3.5-2\*2\*3\*0.8 = 29.9. *Time taken: 1 minute*

Task 7: Omer: (0.5^2\*400+0.7^2\*100)/500 = 0.298 . Limor: 0.287856072 *Time taken: 1 minute*
